dpad defaults for controls where increment and decrement are used i.e., 

<port tag=":LETA0" type="P1_DIAL" mask="255" defvalue="0">
                <newseq type="increment">
                    JOYCODE_1_HAT1RIGHT OR JOYCODE_1_SLIDER2_RIGHT_SWITCH
                </newseq>
                <newseq type="decrement">
                    JOYCODE_1_HAT1LEFT OR JOYCODE_1_SLIDER2_LEFT_SWITCH
                </newseq>
            </port>

when only standard and uses both dpad and joystick, joystick is default - which is correct

first game launch need to be edited - doesn't load data correctly
done - Vertical alignment not working again - need to fix
done - prefix for some directionals not showing in preview
? -prefix for one game did not show with --show-preview, but showed the next time...
